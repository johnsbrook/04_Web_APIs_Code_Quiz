## Web API: Code Quiz - Travel Destinations

This code quiz is a fun way to know a bit more about the different places around the world. After the player answers each question, it will accumulate a score or the timer will be reduced by ten (10) seconds. At the end of the game, you will see the player's high score and name.

This generator was created using:

* HTML - to establish the structure
* CSS - to style the structure and make it appealing for the user
* JavaScript - to run the quiz, set score and timer and display the player's high score and name.
